# BukBox Address Management System

## Overview
Enhanced address management system for BukBox that allows users to save addresses during checkout, fetch saved addresses dynamically, and auto-populate pincode based on GPS location.

## Key Features

### 1. **Saved Address Integration**
- ✅ Fetch user's saved addresses from database
- ✅ Display saved addresses in checkout flow
- ✅ Quick selection of existing addresses
- ✅ Default address highlighting

### 2. **Auto-Pincode Detection**
- ✅ GPS-based pincode extraction
- ✅ Read-only pincode field (user cannot modify)
- ✅ Real-time pincode update on location change
- ✅ Validation for pincode availability

### 3. **Address Saving During Checkout**
- ✅ Automatic address saving to user profile
- ✅ Address type selection (Home, Work, Other)
- ✅ Custom address naming for "Other" type
- ✅ First address automatically set as default

### 4. **Enhanced User Experience**
- ✅ Toggle between saved addresses and new address form
- ✅ Visual indicators for selected addresses
- ✅ Seamless integration with existing checkout flow
- ✅ Location-based address validation

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
The existing `addresses` table supports all required functionality:

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.addresses (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  type TEXT CHECK (type IN ('home', 'work', 'other')),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  phone TEXT,
  address_line_1 TEXT NOT NULL,
  address_line_2 TEXT,
  landmark TEXT,
  city TEXT NOT NULL,
  state TEXT NOT NULL,
  pincode TEXT NOT NULL,
  latitude DECIMAL(10, 8),
  longitude DECIMAL(11, 8),
  is_default BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now()
);
```

### Enhanced Checkout Flow

#### Step 3: Address Details (Updated)
```
1. Check for saved addresses
2. If saved addresses exist:
   - Display saved address cards
   - Allow selection of existing address
   - Option to add new address
3. If no saved addresses or user chooses new:
   - Show address form
   - Auto-populate pincode from GPS
   - Save address option (always enabled)
4. Validation and proceed to payment
```

### Key Functions Added

#### 1. **fetchSavedAddresses()**
```typescript
const fetchSavedAddresses = async () => {
  const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
  if (!user) return;

  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('addresses')
    .select('*')
    .eq('user_id', user.id)
    .order('is_default', { ascending: false });

  setSavedAddresses(data || []);
};
```

#### 2. **extractPincodeFromLocation()**
```typescript
const extractPincodeFromLocation = async (lat: number, lng: number) => {
  const geocoder = new google.maps.Geocoder();
  const response = await geocoder.geocode({ location: { lat, lng } });
  
  const pincodeComponent = response.results[0].address_components.find(
    component => component.types.includes('postal_code')
  );
  
  return pincodeComponent?.long_name || '';
};
```

#### 3. **handleLocationSelect()**
```typescript
const handleLocationSelect = async (location: any) => {
  setDeliveryLocation(location);
  
  // Auto-extract and set pincode
  const pincode = await extractPincodeFromLocation(location.lat, location.lng);
  if (pincode) {
    setAddressDetails(prev => ({ ...prev, pincode }));
  }
};
```

#### 4. **saveAddressToProfile()**
```typescript
const saveAddressToProfile = async () => {
  const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
  if (!user || !deliveryLocation) return;

  const addressData = {
    user_id: user.id,
    name: addressDetails.addressType === 'other' ? addressDetails.saveAs : addressDetails.addressType,
    address_line_1: addressDetails.plotNumber,
    address_line_2: addressDetails.street,
    city: extractCityFromAddress(deliveryLocation.address),
    state: extractStateFromAddress(deliveryLocation.address),
    pincode: addressDetails.pincode,
    landmark: addressDetails.landmark,
    type: addressDetails.addressType,
    latitude: deliveryLocation.lat,
    longitude: deliveryLocation.lng,
    is_default: savedAddresses.length === 0
  };

  await supabase.from('addresses').insert([addressData]);
};
```

## User Journey

### New User (No Saved Addresses)
1. **Location Selection**: User selects location on map
2. **Auto-Pincode**: Pincode automatically extracted and populated
3. **Address Form**: User fills in plot number, street, landmark
4. **Address Type**: User selects Home/Work/Other
5. **Auto-Save**: Address automatically saved to profile
6. **Order Placement**: Address used for current order

### Returning User (Has Saved Addresses)
1. **Saved Addresses**: Display list of saved addresses
2. **Quick Selection**: User clicks on preferred address
3. **Auto-Population**: All address details auto-filled
4. **Location Update**: Map updates to show selected address
5. **Order Placement**: Selected address used for order

### Alternative Flow (New Address for Returning User)
1. **Saved Addresses**: User sees saved addresses
2. **Add New**: User clicks "Add New Address"
3. **New Address Flow**: Same as new user flow
4. **Address Saving**: New address added to saved addresses

## Validation Rules

### Location-Based Validation
- ✅ **Pincode Required**: Must be auto-detected from location
- ✅ **GPS Coordinates**: Must have valid lat/lng
- ✅ **Address Components**: Must extract city/state from location

### Form Validation
- ✅ **Plot Number**: Required for new addresses
- ✅ **Street**: Required for new addresses
- ✅ **Address Type**: Must select Home/Work/Other
- ✅ **Custom Name**: Required if type is "Other"

### Database Validation
- ✅ **User Authentication**: Must be logged in to save addresses
- ✅ **Unique Constraints**: Prevent duplicate addresses
- ✅ **Default Address**: Only one default per user

## Security Features

### Data Protection
- ✅ **RLS Policies**: Users can only access their own addresses
- ✅ **Input Sanitization**: All address inputs sanitized
- ✅ **GPS Validation**: Coordinates validated before storage

### Privacy Controls
- ✅ **User Consent**: Address saving is transparent to user
- ✅ **Data Minimization**: Only necessary address data stored
- ✅ **Deletion Rights**: Users can delete saved addresses

## Performance Optimizations

### Database Queries
- ✅ **Indexed Queries**: Efficient address retrieval by user_id
- ✅ **Limited Results**: Only show top 5 recent addresses in picker
- ✅ **Cached Results**: Address list cached during checkout session

### API Calls
- ✅ **Debounced Geocoding**: Prevent excessive API calls
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback for API failures
- ✅ **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry for failed geocoding

## Error Handling

### Common Scenarios
1. **No GPS Permission**: Fallback to manual address entry
2. **Invalid Location**: Show error and request re-selection
3. **Geocoding Failure**: Allow manual pincode entry as fallback
4. **Database Errors**: Show user-friendly error messages
5. **Network Issues**: Offline address validation

### User Feedback
- ✅ **Loading States**: Show loading during address operations
- ✅ **Success Messages**: Confirm address saving
- ✅ **Error Messages**: Clear error descriptions
- ✅ **Validation Hints**: Guide users to fix issues

## Future Enhancements
