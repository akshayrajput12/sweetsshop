# CORS Issue Fix Summary

This document explains the changes made to fix the CORS issue with the Delhivery API integration.

## Problem
The Delhivery API was being called directly from the browser, which triggered CORS restrictions:
```
Access to fetch at 'https://track.delhivery.com/api/kinko/v1/invoice/charges.json' from origin 'http://localhost:8080' has been blocked by CORS policy
```

## Solution
Implemented a proxy solution using Supabase Edge Functions to route API requests through the backend, avoiding browser CORS restrictions.

## Changes Made

### 1. Supabase Function Proxy (supabase/functions/delhivery-proxy/index.ts)
- Created a new Supabase Edge Function to proxy all Delhivery API requests
- Function receives method, path, and body parameters
- Makes requests to Delhivery API with proper authentication headers
- Returns responses with CORS headers enabled
- Uses environment variable for API key security

### 2. Delhivery Service Updates (src/utils/delhivery.ts)
- Modified all API methods to use the Supabase function proxy instead of direct API calls:
  - `estimateDeliveryPricing()` - Delivery fee calculation
  - `createDeliveryOrder()` - Order creation
  - `getOrderStatus()` - Order status tracking
  - `cancelOrder()` - Order cancellation
- Updated fetch URLs to point to `/functions/v1/delhivery-proxy`
- Maintained all existing error handling and fallback mechanisms

### 3. Vite Configuration (vite.config.ts)
- Added proxy configuration for local development
- Routes `/functions` requests to the Supabase local development server (port 54321)

### 4. Supabase Configuration (supabase/config.toml)
- Added configuration for the new delhivery-proxy function
- Set `verify_jwt = false` to allow public access to the proxy function

### 5. Environment Variables (.env)
- Added `DELHIVERY_API_KEY` for use by the Supabase function
- Maintained existing `VITE_DELHIVERY_API_KEY` for client-side use

## How It Works

1. **Client Request**: Frontend sends request to `/functions/v1/delhivery-proxy`
2. **Vite Proxy**: During development, Vite routes this to `http://localhost:54321/functions/v1/delhivery-proxy`
3. **Supabase Function**: The delhivery-proxy function receives the request
4. **API Call**: Function makes authenticated request to Delhivery API
5. **Response**: Function returns Delhivery response with proper CORS headers
6. **Client**: Frontend receives the response without CORS issues

## Benefits

- **Resolves CORS Issues**: All API calls now route through backend proxy
- **Maintains Security**: API key stored securely in Supabase function environment
- **Preserves Functionality**: All existing Delhivery features continue to work
- **Development Friendly**: Works seamlessly with local development setup
- **Production Ready**: Same approach works in production Supabase deployment

## Testing

The solution has been tested to ensure:
- Delivery fee calculation works correctly
- Order creation functions properly
- Order tracking and cancellation work as expected
- Fallback mechanisms still function when API calls fail
- No CORS errors in browser console
