3. Order saved to database with order_status: 'placed'
4. Coupon usage updated (if applicable)
5. Success message displayed
6. Cart cleared
7. Redirect to profile/orders page
```

### Online Payment Flow
```
1. Customer selects Online Payment
2. Razorpay payment modal opens
3. Customer completes payment
4. Payment verification (automatic)
5. If payment successful:
   - Order saved with payment_status: 'paid'
   - Order status set to 'confirmed'
   - Razorpay transaction IDs stored
   - Coupon usage updated
   - Success message displayed
   - Cart cleared
   - Redirect to profile/orders page
6. If payment fails:

   - Order not created
   - Customer can retry
```
